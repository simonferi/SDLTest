# SDLTest

## Project Description:
This project is a lightweight, easy-to-use 2D game development library powered by CMake and built on top of SDL2. Designed for simplicity and efficiency, the library provides a streamlined framework for creating 2D games with robust features such as game asset management and cross-platform support.

## Key features include:

* Game Asset Management: Built-in support for efficiently loading, caching, and managing textures, audio files, and fonts.
* Modular Design: A clean and modular architecture that allows developers to focus on gameplay mechanics while minimizing boilerplate code.
* Cross-Platform Compatibility: Leverages SDL2 to ensure seamless deployment across Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* CMake Integration: Simplifies the build process with CMake, offering easy configuration and extensibility for projects of any scale.

This library is ideal for developers seeking to prototype or build 2D games quickly without the complexity of heavier frameworks. Whether you're creating a simple arcade game or a more intricate 2D project, this library provides all the essential tools to get started.
